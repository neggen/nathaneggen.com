								<p>I am a former graduate student of the <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/mifa">Minnesota Institute for Astrophysics.</a> My research focused on understanding the role of dwarf starburst galaxies during the epoch of reionization.</p>
								<p>My career in research began in 2015 at the <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/"></a>University of Wisconsin - Madison, where I worked on a <a href="https://neggen.github.io/#work">variety of projects</a>. I recieved my Bachelor of Science in Astronomy with honors, as well as in Physics, and Mathematics in 2017.</p>
								<p>I then moved to Minneapolis to pursue a PhD in Astrophysics. There I worked as both a Teaching Assistant, and Research Assistant with <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/physics/m-claudia-scarlata">Dr. Claudia Scarlata</a>, where I used Integral Field Spectroscopy to map nebular gas dynamics, ionization states, temperatures, and other properties of nearby dwarf galaxies.</p>
								<p>Now, I am coming off a <a href="https://neggen.github.io/#about">gap year</a> and looking for work in a role where the skills I have learned can make an impact.</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/MyHeadSmaller.jpg" alt=""/></span>
								<!--<p>In my senior year of high school, the school newspaper was going around to graduating seniors and asking them, "What do you want to be when you grow up?" My interst in astronomy was beginning to bud at that time, and so even though I didn't fully believe it I answered, "An Astrophysicist." My lack of belief in this future was evident in my original choice of major in college, Physics rather than Astronomy. It was the writings of the philosopher Alan Watts that gave me the final push to take the chance on Astrophysics, and so I threw myself into research projects and added two more majors, Math and Astronomy, in a bid to impress future graduate schools. </p>-->
								<p>When I decided to apply to graduate schools for Astrophysics back in 2015, I did so not for the prestige of earning a PhD, but because being an Astronomer was my dream. By early 2020, however, it became clear that Astronomy was not the calling I thought it to be. Therefore I began working toward graduation, and as I thought about my future beyond academia, it occurred to me that in my 21 years of schooling I was never taught how to understand myself. So in early October 2020 I graduated with a Masters, and decided to take an extended break. In the year since, I've taken the opportunity to explore myself, my interests, and the career opportunities available to me.</p>

								<h3 class="major">The Math Hidden in the Background</h3>
								<h4>and what it says about Data Science</h4>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/bg.png" alt="" /><caption><font size = "-1">Image Credit: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lnsse0/oc_prime_numbers_plotted_on_polar_coordinates/">/u/upzylon</a></font></caption></span>
								<p>Above is what you get when you plot prime numbers in <a href="https://nrich.maths.org/2755">polar coordinates.</a> Each number is plotted its distance away from the origin, and at an angle equal to its value in radians, where an angle of 2π radians is a full circle around.</p> 
								<!--  -->
								<p>I love this image because the grand patterns made by the primes demand an equally grand explanation. Unfortunately for us, there is no grand reason. The <a href="https://galaxyzooblog.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/milky_way_galaxy.jpg">spirals</a> near the center that expand out to reveal seemingly infinite rays do not reveal some long hidden secret about numbers, or the universe. The explanation for both is just a result of how the numbers are plotted, and an interesting property of π.</p>

								<p>Compared with other irrational numbers, <a href="https://youtu.be/CaasbfdJdJg?t=594">π has remarkably good rational approximations.</a> Namely, 3, 22 &frasl; 7, and 355 &frasl; 113 all do relatively well at approximating it, and multiplying them by 2 makes them close to 2π. For example, the number 44 falls very close to being exactly 14π, or 7<span>&#215;</span>2π. Translating that to polar coordinates, this means that 44 is very close to 7 revolutions around the center. In fact it's slightly more. In the plot below, the point closest to the center is 44, which highlights exactly how closely it aligns with an angle of 0, or 2π, radians.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Onefactor44Arc.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Now, if you extend further out, you'll find that 88 is very close to being exactly 7 revolutions beyond 44, but again it will be slightly more than 7 revolutions. Each multiple of 44, therefore, will fall nearly in a straight line from the center, with each subsequent multiple adding a minor offset each time. That cumulative offset incrementally grows into the spiral pattern shown above. Another spiral can be made by adding 1 to every point in the above spiral, moving the whole set of points 1 radian counterclockwise. This process can be repeated 43 times. Doing so gives a grand total of 44 separate spirals, shown below. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Allfactor44Arc.png" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Finally, removing all non-prime numbers is what creates the gaps within the spirals, and the missing arms evident in the original image.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/OnlyPrimes44Arc.png" alt=""/></span>

								<p>This same pattern is present for the other two approximations of π mentioned earlier. Zooming into the center of the original image would reveal the spirals formed from how close 2π is to 6. In addition, those "rays" at the edges of the original image are in reality the beginnings of the spirals formed from how close 2π is to 710 &frasl; 113. The photo is just not zoomed out enough to make the curvature noticable, and so they look straight.</p>

								<h3>Why do I care so much?</h3>
								<p>Well, I like math. More interesting, however, is what it highlights about Data Science.</p>

								<p>The way in which data is represented can drastically affect the way in which it's interpreted. Here, the decision to plot prime numbers in a polar coordinate system was completely arbitrary. For example, primes can just as easily be represented on a number line, but using a polar coordinate system revealed new patterns not present on the number line. If the goal was to study primes, it would be easy, tempting even, to immediately assume that the patterns revealed are due to the primes rather than an outside influence. In this case, an understanding of the math embedded in the coordinate system saved us from a costly misinterpretation of the data.</p>

								<p>The same can be said more generally about Data Science, and indeed, all Data Analysis, where math forms the foundation of the field. One of the first lessons I learned as a graduate researcher was that freely available software packages are useful, but only to a point. When dealing with challenging data, the flexibility and understanding of self written code greatly outweighs black-box software packages. Like an artisan, much of a Data Scientist's skill stems from their understanding of their tools, which in this case is the math hidden in the background.</p>
